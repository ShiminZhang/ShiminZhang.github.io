### **Professional History**
After witnessing the failure of the game FFXV, my interests guided me to learn about game developments and engines, and making minigames. The first minigame I made earned me a intern offer from Tencent IEG, and the next one I made during the internship earned me a return offer. During the internship, I assisted with the refactory of game ai system of our product in Tencent. Starting from then, I continuously explore the possiblities of applying ML in game production and content, including code generation, text-to-speech ai voice etc. After two years of working as a game developper, I decided to go to graduate school to learn more detail about ml and its applications, as well as research techniques, to further apply ml into industry one day.
